## Next store

### How to run

1. clone the git repo
2. cd project folder
3. run "npm i --force" (some legacy packages need to be forced to install as i am using latest Next js)
4. run "npm run dev"

### Packages used

1. Next Js version 15
2. zustand for state managment
3. react toastify
4. typescript
5. SSR used along side prereload render for client side components

Note: While using latest Next js 15 to utilize the latest rendring technologies, i faced some outdated packages related to zustand and react toastify, however using "--force" will fix all issues and will work normally
